            <h1>Italian Pizza</h1>
            <img src="../images/pizza.jpg" alt="This is an authentic Italian Pizza">
       <h2 class="about">About Pizza</h2>
        <p>Pizza, a dish of Italian origin consisting of a flattened disk of bread dough topped with
             some combination of olive oil, oregano, tomato, olives, mozzarella or other cheese, and 
             many other ingredients, baked quickly—usually, in a commercial setting, using a wood-fired 
             oven heated to a very high temperature<<p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>600 mL of warm water</li>
            <li>7 cups (1kg) flour, type “00”*</li>
            <li>2.5 - 3 tablespoons (25 grams) of fresh yeast or 2 teaspoons (7-8 grams) of dried yeast.</li> 
            <li>6 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>1.5 teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons sugar</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Process of Making</h2>
        <h3>Step-1</h3>
        <p>Sprinkle the yeast into a medium bowl with the warm water.
            We don’t mean hot, and we don’t mean cold… we mean warm!
            That’s the kind the yeast likes best. Stir until the yeast
            dissolves.</p>
        <h3>Step-2</h3>
        <p>Place almost all of the flour on the table in the shape of a volcano.
            (Think Mt. Vesuvius… appropriate since Naples is the king of all pizza cities!).<<p>
        <h3>Step-3</h3>
        <p>Pour the yeast-and-warm-water mix, along with the other ingredients,
            into the “crater” of the volcano.</p>
        <h3>Step-4</h3>
        <p>Knead everything together for 10 to 15 minutes until the dough is smooth and 
            elastic, keeping your surface floured.</p>
        <h3>Step-5</h3>
        <p>Grease up a bowl with some olive oil and put the dough inside.
            Turn the dough around so the top is slightly oiled.</p>
        <h3>Step-6</h3>
        <p>Cover the bowl and put the dough aside to let it rest for at least four or five hours.</p>
        <h3>Step-7</h3>
        <p>Preheat the oven to about 400°F, or about 200°C.Dump the dough out of the bowl and back onto
            the floured surface. Punch it down, getting rid of any bubbles.</p>
        <h3>Step-8</h3>
        <p>Divide the dough in half and let it rest for a few minutes.
            Roll each section into a 12-inch disc. Now’s your chance to decide how thick you want your pizza
            to be! Do you want it pizza alta (Neapolitan-style) or pizza bassa (Roman-style)? Just remember,
            your crust will puff up a little bit as it’s baked!</p>
        <h3>Step-9</h3>
        <p>Transfer the dough onto an oiled pizza pan or baking sheet.</p>
        <h3>Step-10</h3>
        <p>Add tomato sauce, if you want a pizza rossa (red pizza). Lots of pizzas in Italy are actually pizza
            bianca, without tomato sauce, so don’t feel like you have to! Brush the edges of the crust with a little
            bit of olive oil.</p>
        <h3>Step-11</h3>
        <p>Bake each pizza for about 10 minutes, then add mozzarella cheese (sliced or grated) on top, 
            as well as any other ingredients.</p>
        <h3>Step-12</h3>
        <p>Let the pizzas bake until the crust is browned and the cheese is melted. By lifting up the 
            pizza to peek underneath, you can make sure the bottom has browned, too.<<p>
        <h3>Step-13</h3>
        <p>Remove your pizzas from the oven and, for a real Italian touch, garnish with a few 
            basil leaves. And enjoy!</p>
