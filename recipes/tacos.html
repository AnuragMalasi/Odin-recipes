    <h2 class="about">About Tacos</h2>
    <p>A taco is a traditional Mexican food consisting of a small hand-sized corn- or
        wheat-based tortilla topped with a filling. The tortilla is then folded around
        the filling and eaten by hand. </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound chicken</li>
        <li>1 (1 ounce) packet taco seasoning mix, divided</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) can refried beans</li>
        <li>⅔ cup water</li>
        <li>12 prepared crisp taco shells</li>
        <li>2 avocados</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sour cream</li>
        <li>1 fresh lime,juiced</li>
        <li>salt and black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>12 (7 inch) flour tortillas</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded lettuce</li>
        <li>1 large tomato, chopped</li>
        <li>¼ red onion, chopped</li>
        <li>½ cup sour cream</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Process of Making</h2>
    <h3>Step-1</h3>
    <p>Place the chicken in a skillet over medium heat,
        and sprinkle about 3/4 of the packet of taco seasoning 
        over the meat. Cook and stir the chicken, breaking
        it up as it cooks, until the chicken is browned and crumbly, 
        10 to 15 minutes. Drain the excess grease. </p>
    <h3>Step-2</h3>
    <p>Mash the refried beans with the water in a small saucepan,
        and sprinkle with the rest of the seasoning packet. Heat
        the refried beans over low heat until simmering. </p>
    <h3>Step-3</h3>
    <p>Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Place the
        crisp taco shells on a baking sheet, and warm them in the
        preheated oven for 3 to 5 minutes. </p>
    <h3>Step-4</h3>
    <p>To make the guacamole, peel, seed, and mash the avocados in
        a bowl with 1 tablespoon of sour cream, the lime juice, and
        salt and pepper to taste, and set aside. </p>
    <h3>Step-5(Assemble the taco)</h3>
    <p>To build the tacos, spread each flour tortilla with about 2
        tablespoons of heated refried beans. Wrap the tortilla gently
        around a crisp tortilla shell. Spread about 2 tablespoons of
        chicken along the bottom of the crisp shell, and sprinkle
        about 2 tablespoons of shredded Cheddar cheese on top of the
        meat. Top the cheese with shredded lettuce, a sprinkle of
        chopped tomato and onion, and a dollop of sour cream and 
        guacamole.</p>
